of the global Python community to submit talk proposals and tutorial proposals
for our conference happening at the &lt;a href="http://www.sp.edu.sg/"&gt;Singapore Polytechnic&lt;/a&gt;
from 17-19 June 2015.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Once again we've got the support of great keynote speakers:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Andrew Godwin (Django core developer, creator of South)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Jessica McKellar (OpenHatch, Twisted, Python Software Foundation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Lynn Root (Spotify, PyLadies, Python Software Foundation)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We also have some awesome talks lined up, given by developers of the local
community, on everything from web development, to infrastructure, to API
development. However, we still have many slots available and would really love
to hear from you!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Whether you're a seasoned pro, or a beginner who has an interesting story to
tell, we welcome all proposals for technical talks of about 30-40 minutes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To submit a talk, please register at &lt;a href="https://pycon.sg/proposals/"&gt;https://pycon.sg/proposals/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The closing date for proposals is 30th April 2015, but we'd appreciate it if you
can submit your idea earlier.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you'd like to get in touch via email, ping us at conference(at)pycon.sg&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Don't wait! We're looking forward to receiving your submissions! We should also
mention that for the first time we will grant a 25% rebate on the conference
ticket for speakers.&lt;/p&gt;</summary><category term="pyconsg"></category></entry><entry><title>Thank You for Attending PyCon SG 2014</title><link href="/2014-pyconsg-thank-you.html" rel="alternate"></link><updated>2014-06-24T00:00:00+08:00</updated><author><name>Ivan</name></author><id>tag:,2014-06-24:2014-pyconsg-thank-you.html</id><summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/mbrochh/14465517992/"&gt;&lt;img alt="PyConSG 2014 attendees" src="/img/2014-pyconsg-crowd.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;On behalf of all the PyCon organizing committee members, I would like to thank
all attendees for taking time off to attend PyCon Singapore 2014 which was held at
&lt;a href="http://www.sp.edu.sg/"&gt;Singapore Polytechnic&lt;/a&gt; from 18th June to 20th June.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We organized this conference for the Python developer and student community in
Singapore and we are very grateful for your support.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Your feedback regarding the conference will be critical in order for the
organizing committee to make PyCon SG 2015 even better than this year's
conference. A short &lt;a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1A5NoxhvrD2mnrT47b88LKjng63v3kZfT6smDOSc5rAk/viewform"&gt;feedback form&lt;/a&gt;
is available online which shall not take more than five minutes to
complete.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We have requested all speakers of the conference to send us links or PDF copies
of their slide decks. For those of you who are eager to view them, do look out
for updates on &lt;a href="https://pycon.sg/news/2014/6/21/slides/"&gt;this blog post&lt;/a&gt;
which will be updated as as we receive the slide decks from the speakers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This conference would not have been possible without the tremendous support we
have received. I would like to thank our sponsors, &lt;a href="http://www.sp.edu.sg"&gt;Singapore
Polytechnic&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="http://www.heroku.com/"&gt;Heroku&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href="http://www.odd-e.com/"&gt;Odd-e&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href="https://www.zopim.com/"&gt;Zopim&lt;/a&gt;,
&lt;a href="http://www.oracle.com/"&gt;Oracle&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://continuum.io/"&gt;Continuum
Analytics&lt;/a&gt;, as well as Mr Gi and student helpers from
&lt;a href="http://www.dhs.sg/"&gt;Dunman High School&lt;/a&gt; who played a huge role in ensuring that
the conference ran smoothly. Special thanks go out to our keynote speakers David
Cramer and Kenneth Reitz for flying down all the way from US to inspire us with
their keynotes.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, as the chair of this conference, I would like to thank the organizing
committee for all their hard work in the past year to make this conference a
reality. In the coming weeks, we will be holding a meeting to elect the
organizing committee for PyCon SG 2015. If you are interested in joining the
PyCon 2015 committee, you may let us know on the feedback form above.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Sincerely,
Victor Neo&lt;/p&gt;
