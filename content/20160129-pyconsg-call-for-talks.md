[PyCon Singapore 2016](https://pycon.sg/) is happening again! Mark your calendars
for June 23 to 25.

Once again we've got the support of great keynote speakers:

* Daniel and Audrey Greenfeld ([Two Scoops of Django](https://www.twoscoopspress.com), [Django Packages](https://www.djangopackages.com/))
* Dr. Yves J. Hilpisch ([The Python Quants](http://tpq.io/), [Python for Finance (O'Reilly 2014)](http://python-for-finance.com/))

We also have some awesome talks lined up, given by developers of the local
community on subjects like web development, devops, CS education, and data
analytics. However, we still have many slots available.  Whether you're a
seasoned pro, or a beginner who has an interesting story to tell, we welcome all
proposals for technical talks of about 30 minutes.

To submit a talk, please register at [https://pycon.sg/proposals/](https://pycon.sg/proposals/).

The closing date for proposals is 30th April 2016, but we'd appreciate it if you
can submit your idea earlier.

If you'd like to get in touch via email, ping us at conference(at)pycon.sg

Don't wait! We're looking forward to receiving your submissions! We should also
mention that for the first time we will grant a 25% rebate on the conference
ticket for speakers.
