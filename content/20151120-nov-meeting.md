Thanks to those who attended our PUGS Meetup last Friday!  It was a fruitful
information session and with suggestions from the community for content ranging
from suggested topics for courses and talks:

* Python 101 and Python 102 courses (preferably on the weekend)
* Web Programming in Python in various Web Frameworks e.g.Django, Flask
* Rasberry Pi
* Spark
* Data Analytics and Data Manipulation in Python
* How to get hired with Python
* Comparison of Languages e.g. Java vs Scala vs Python

There was popular demand for our meetups to be once a month to maintain
consistency and community involvement. In addition, we have a couple of
volunteers for the PyCon next year. We will be arranging for the PyCon Committee
to meet up soon.  We will start planning out the Python 101 and 102 course and
use the other interested topics as content for subsequent meetups.
