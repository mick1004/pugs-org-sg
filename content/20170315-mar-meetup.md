# Talk

**Exploring Singapore's Open Data APIs**

*Abstract:* Open data is data that is available to anyone, without fee, copyright,
or restrictions on usage, and Singapore is one of many governments that have
started providing open data feeds. This talk will explore the use of open data
from a developers point of view, and show the possibilities and limitations when
dealing with Singapore's Open Data APIs.

*Bio:* Haoyi is a software engineer, previously working at Dropbox, currently
working on a developer tools startup in Singapore. He's interested in
programming languages, developer productivity, web development, and automation.
