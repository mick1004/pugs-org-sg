## Talks

1. Writing a Serverless Python Microservice with AWS Lambda by David Chua

    *Synopsis:* Want to run a Serverless Microservice? What is Serverless? In this short
    little introduction I'll demonstrate how to get a quick python microservice
    out from scratch into the cloud and never have to worry about infrastructure
    scaling ever again. 

    *Bio*: David is a former Rubyist with strong inclination towards the
    infrastructure/backend side whom has joined the Dark Side about 2 months ago.
    He is looking forward to learning and contributing to the amazing PUGS
    community. In a former life, he run a digital consultancy but now works for <https://99.co>.

2. Update on [PyConSG](https://pycon.sg) which is happening next month!
