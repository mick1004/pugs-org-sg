Next regular user meeting is scheduled for February 26 at 7pm at [PayPal
Singapore](https://www.paypal.com/sg/) (UPDATE: at Millenia Office), 1 Temasek
Avenue, Millenia Tower, #14-01.  Our friendly hosts have graciously offered to
provide pizzas and drinks! 

Speakers:

- Kokhong Cheng - virtualenv in the enterprise environment
  ([video](http://youtu.be/-XgYrGzzfFI)).

- Martijn Faassen - [MorePath](https://github.com/morepath/morepath) and
  [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/index.html).  
  Update: the central theme of my talk is going to be hypermedia, 
  in both APIs and UIs. Morepath was designed to let you build hypermedia APIs 
  (aka REST APIs), and I'll go into some of the whys and hows and future 
  directions ([video](http://youtu.be/eWd7zlM77oo)).
