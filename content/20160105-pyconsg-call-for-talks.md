The organizing committee for [PyCon Singapore 2016](https://pycon.sg/) would
like to invite members of the Python community to submit talk proposals and
tutorial proposals for our conference happening from June 23 to 25, 2016.

Once again we've got the support of great keynote speakers:

* Andrew Godwin (Django core developer, creator of South)
* Jessica McKellar (OpenHatch, Twisted, Python Software Foundation)
* Lynn Root (Spotify, PyLadies, Python Software Foundation)

We also have some awesome talks lined up, given by developers of the local
community, on everything from web development, to infrastructure, to API
development. However, we still have many slots available and would really love
to hear from you!

Whether you're a seasoned pro, or a beginner who has an interesting story to
tell, we welcome all proposals for technical talks of about 30-40 minutes.

To submit a talk, please register at [https://pycon.sg/proposals/](https://pycon.sg/proposals/).

The closing date for proposals is 30th April 2015, but we'd appreciate it if you
can submit your idea earlier.

If you'd like to get in touch via email, ping us at conference(at)pycon.sg

Don't wait! We're looking forward to receiving your submissions! We should also
mention that for the first time we will grant a 25% rebate on the conference
ticket for speakers.
