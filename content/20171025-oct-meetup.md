## Agenda

**7pm: Meet & Greet**

**7:30pm: NLTK and Friends by Liling Tan**

The talk will be a basic crash course to Natural Language Processing (NLP). We
will try to build a simple application in 30 minutes using NLTK and friends
(Scikit-Learn, SpaCy, Gensim and maybe, just maybe PyTorch)
[[slides](https://goo.gl/cg7iza)].

[Liling](https://21.co/alvations/) is a data geek that works mostly with text
processing and machine translation. He contributes to NLTK and seeks help from
StackOverflow whenever he works with Pandas dataframe. 



**8:00pm: Introduction to AWS Lambda with Python by Maximilian Jackson**

Max is a regular visitor of our monthly user group meetups and has been an
active member of the Python User Group and an organizer of PyCon APAC and PyCon
Singapore for years. He has recently had the need to figure out how to deploy
Python functions to AWS Lambda and would like to share his findings with the
community.
