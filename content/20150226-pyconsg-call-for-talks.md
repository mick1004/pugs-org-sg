The organizing committee for [PyCon Singapore 2015](https://pycon.sg/) would like to invite members
of the global Python community to submit talk proposals and tutorial proposals
for our conference happening at the [Singapore Polytechnic](http://www.sp.edu.sg/)
from 17-19 June 2015.

Once again we've got the support of great keynote speakers:

* Andrew Godwin (Django core developer, creator of South)
* Jessica McKellar (OpenHatch, Twisted, Python Software Foundation)
* Lynn Root (Spotify, PyLadies, Python Software Foundation)

We also have some awesome talks lined up, given by developers of the local
community, on everything from web development, to infrastructure, to API
development. However, we still have many slots available and would really love
to hear from you!

Whether you're a seasoned pro, or a beginner who has an interesting story to
tell, we welcome all proposals for technical talks of about 30-40 minutes.

To submit a talk, please register at [https://pycon.sg/proposals/](https://pycon.sg/proposals/).

The closing date for proposals is 30th April 2015, but we'd appreciate it if you
can submit your idea earlier.

If you'd like to get in touch via email, ping us at conference(at)pycon.sg

Don't wait! We're looking forward to receiving your submissions! We should also
mention that for the first time we will grant a 25% rebate on the conference
ticket for speakers.
