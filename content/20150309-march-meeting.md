## Talks

1. "Getting started with testing using Pytest and Mock" by Gabe Hollombe ([video](http://youtu.be/k99HSHQDsi4)).

    Pytest is a great alternative testing framework to unittest from the
    standard library. It often lets you get the same tests written with
    far fewer lines of code, and it has a cool dependency injection system
    to help you share common test dependencies while keeping your tests
    understandable. I'll tell you all about how to get basic unit testing
    done, and I'll show you how to use Voidspace's Mock library to test
    collaborations between your objects, too.

    Gabe is a full-stack senior engineer at Neo Innovation, with a thirst
    for knowledge and a passion for sharing what he's learned. He's had
    the pleasure of speaking on four different continents about
    JavaScript, Ruby, Vim, and HTML5 Game development.

2. "Developing real time applications in Django with Websockets" by Gerald Goh ([video](http://youtu.be/yRynX4N3rog)).

    I'll be showing how to build a simple real time chat application in Django
    using [swampdragon](http://swampdragon.net/).

    Gerald is a full stack developer at Apvera Pte. Ltd., a security analytics
    startup.

3. "Five Python tips" by Martin Brochhaus ([video](http://youtu.be/zGA_ByAxFW8), [slides](http://mbrochh.github.io/three-python-tips/))

    We are hoping to repeat this talk with different speakers at the end
    of each meetup. Martin will make the start and give quick
    introductions to five Python tools that will make your life easier:

    * Virtualenv / pyenv
    * Tox
    * pip-tools
    * the @property decorator
    * Fabric

    Martin is the founder of Bitmazk Pte. Ltd., a Singapore based web
    development agency specialized on creating web apps with Python and
    Django. He is also part of the organizing committee for PyCon

    Singapore and an active member of Python User Group Singapore.

4. Alfred from PyCon APAC will talk about the upcoming [APAC conference in Taiwan][apac].

5.  "How to learn and be productive with Python3 in a week" by Chris ([video](http://youtu.be/2IietZ8cVIc)).

    Chris will talk about how you can go from knowing nothing of Python to being productive in a week.

    * Basic Python syntax and environment setup (  IDE, virtualenv )
    * Data types
    * How to use libraries


## Would you like to speak at this or a future meetups?

You could share about your technology stack, how you solved a problem,
your new library, or your opinions on best practices, so that people
can get to know how awesome you are!

5 Python tips is a small segment at the end of meetup where you can
share some things that make your Python life easier. A newly
discovered core module, a library or some command line tool that makes
your life better and/or easier.

So don't be shy! Step forward and share your knowledge!
