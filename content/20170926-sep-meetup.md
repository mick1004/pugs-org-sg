## Agenda

**7pm: Meet & Greet**

**7:30pm: Talk #1: Using Kivy to Write an iOS and Android App by Chao-Jen Chen**

*Abstract:*
Kivy is an open source Python framework that allows developers to write apps for
and run the same code on Linux, Windows, Mac OS X, iOS, and Android. I will walk
through an end-to-end process, from coding an app using Kivy library to
deploying the same app to iOS and Android devices using Kivy toolchains.

*Bio*:
Chao-Jen Chen is a university instructor teaching Calculus, Probability, and
Linear Algebra. He used to work in the finance industry as fixed income
quantitative analyst and FX manager, managing and hedging USD3bn FX exposure to
more than 20 currencies. His personal research interest is Singaporeâ€™s monetary
policy tool, i.e., the SGD NEER (Singapore Dollar Nominal Effective Exchange
Rate). In April 2017, he released an app in Google Play and Apple App Store that
implemented his SGD NEER model. He also wrote a chapter on numerical computing
in finance for a book (F# Deep Dives, published by Manning Publications Co. in
December, 2014).

**8pm: Talk #2: Welcome to async/await by Dima Tisnek**

*Abstract*: 
[Dima](https://github.com/dimaqq) will present the paradigm of async/await across a few languages (Python3.6
and ES2017) with some live coding.
