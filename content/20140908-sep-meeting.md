An irregular<sup>†</sup> user meeting was held on September 4th, 7:30-9pm at 
[HSG](http://hackerspace.sg) as usual.

[Björn](https://github.com/gaqzi) talked about Reusable Django Apps among other
things ([slides](https://speakerdeck.com/gaqzi/reusable-django-apps)).

<sup>†</sup> Thanks to PayPal for pizza and beers. Hopefully this irregularity
will become part of our regular user meetings...
