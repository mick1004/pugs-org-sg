Next user meeting will be held on February 19th, 7:30-9pm at the
[hackerspace.sg](http://hackerspace.sg).

We'll have [Martijn Faassen](http://startifact.com/) presenting on
[MorePath](https://github.com/morepath/morepath) micro web framework.

"Morepath is an Python WSGI microframework. It uses routing, but the routing
is to models. Morepath is model-driven and flexible, which makes it
expressive." ([docs](http://morepath.readthedocs.org/en/latest/))
