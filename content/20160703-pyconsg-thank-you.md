The organizing committee would like to thank everyone for coming to PyCon
Singapore 2016. This year we had over 250 participants! This conference is only
possible because of your interest! Here are some

conference. And if you’ve missed a talk in a parallel session, you may want to

A big thank you to all the speakers and tutorial instructors. We are very happy
to see a growing number of women presenting their work.

Special thanks to our keynote speakers Daniel and Audrey Roy Greenfeld and Yves
J. Hilpisch for coming all the way to Singapore, and sharing your knowledge and
experience.

This year we were lucky again to have [student volunteers and Mr.
