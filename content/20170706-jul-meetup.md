## Agenda

**7pm: Meet & Greet**
While everyone arrives, we have the chance to chat and mingle, Zendesk is kindly
sponsoring snacks and soft-drinks. 

**7:30pm: Talk #1: Deep Learning with Python in Finance by Ben Ball**

*Abstract:* Python is becoming the de facto standard for many machine learning
applications. We have been using Python with deep learning and other ML
techniques, with a focus in prediction and exploitation in transactional
markets. I am presenting one of our implementations (A dueling double DQN - a
class of Reinforcement Learning algorithm) in Python using TensorFlow, along
with information and background around the class of deep learning algorithm, and
the application to financial markets we have employed. Attendees will learn how
to implement a DQN using Tensorflow, and how to design a system for deep
learning for solving a wide range of problems. The code will be available on
github for attendees.

*Bio*: Ben is a believer in making a career out of what you love. He is inspired
by the joining of excellent technology and research and likes building software
that is easy to use, but does amazing things. His work has spanned 15 years,
with a dual focus in AI Software Engineering and Algorithmic Trading. He is
currently working as the CTO of <http://prediction-machines.com>

**8pm: Talk #2: Introduction to MicroPython - Mighty Python Running on Tiny
Embedded Boards by Ovidiu Hossu**

*Abstract*: Coming soon! Hardware-hackers listen up! Ovidiu will give an
introduction to MicroPython and bring a few of his boards to run some real-world
demos.
