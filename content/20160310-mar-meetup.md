Big thanks to [Red Hat Singapore](http://www.redhat.com/en/global/singapore) for hosting us.
Another big thanks to semi-anonymous pizza sponsors.


## Talks

1. [Sayanee](https://sayan.ee/) went through some cool stats from
   <https://data.webuild.sg/> showing how vibrant and diverse Singapore's
   developers scene is.

2. Ivan's [TDD with pytest](http://vanzaj.github.io/tdd-pytest/) "translation"
   project is hopefully more useful than slides. Pull requests are very welcome.

3. Martin showed that it is now possible to integrate ReactJS with a new or
   an existing Django project without too much pain. His boilerplate repo is
   [here](https://github.com/mbrochh/django-reactjs-boilerplate).
